# Avibe Release Workflow

This document contains the release-specific details that are too operational
for `AGENTS.md`. The workflows are the source of truth for the final commands.

## Tags and notifications

- Tags advance the latest version number, for example `v1.0.1` to `v1.0.2`.
- For an official `v*` release, the annotated tag is the only release-state
  input. Put `<!-- avibe:update-notification=none -->` in the tag annotation
  when the release should suppress update and post-update notifications while
  automatic updates remain enabled.
- Push the tag and let the official workflows create the release. Do not
  pre-create or manually edit a GitHub Release.
- The workflow emits both current and legacy `vibe-remote` update markers for
  installed-client compatibility.

## Workflow ownership and artifacts

The official workflows stage assets and generated notes in a Draft.
`Release (AI Notes)` may update notes but never publishes. `Publish to PyPI` is
the finalizer: it verifies the exact notes run, publishes the asset-complete
GitHub Release, and only then allows PyPI publication.

GitHub-only pre-releases use the `gh-vX.Y.ZrcN` format, such as
`gh-v2.2.8rc2`, so they remain distinct from PyPI-triggering `v*` tags. They
must include an installable wheel containing `ui/dist` and
`vibe/show_runtime/*.tgz`, plus the source distribution.

## Managed-runtime manifests

Published managed-runtime manifests are availability contracts. Keep their
release URLs under the scheduled manifest-verified backup/recovery guard.
Publish replacement assets before changing a pinned manifest so the guard never
restores bytes from a different release.

## Download mirror

`Mirror releases to dl.avibe.bot` copies published release assets to
`https://dl.avibe.bot/releases/<tag>/<asset>` and writes the release index at
`https://dl.avibe.bot/index/releases.json`. It follows the publishing
workflows, so a renamed publishing workflow must also be renamed in its
trigger. The contract and retention rules are in
`docs/plans/release-download-mirror.md`.
