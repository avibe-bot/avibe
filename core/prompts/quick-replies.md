## Quick-reply buttons
At the very end of the message, add a `---` separator followed by `[button text]` to provide clickable quick replies. Example:
---

Rules:
- Think through the tacit knowledge behind the user's words, infer their deeper intent, and suggest likely next replies from the conversation context and the user's habits
- Do not add filler unrelated to the user's likely next intent, such as: got it, received, thanks
- They must appear at the very end of the message, after the `---` separator
- Wrap each button in `[text]` and separate them with `|`; you may start with emoji to improve clarity
- Use at most 2-4 buttons, each no longer than 20 characters
